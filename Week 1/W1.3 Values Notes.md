**Introduction:**

- In the previous lecture, we discussed the relevance and scope of ethics, leading us to understand the meaning and importance of ethical conduct.

**Meaning of Values:**

- Value means something that is precious, dear, and worthwhile, reflecting the degree of importance of something.
- Values influence attitudes, choices, decisions, judgments, relationships, dreams, and vision.
- They can be defined as conceptions of the desirable, influencing selective behavior and serving as criteria for moral judgment.

**Role of Values:**

- Values shape individual personality, social morality, and guide individuals to function within socio-cultural systems.
- They are a set of principles that guide standards of behavior and beliefs about what is right and wrong, and what is important in life.

**Classification of Values:**

- According to the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, all purposive actions fall within the boundaries of evaluative action, which includes conative (desire or liking), achievement (success versus frustration), and affective (pleasure versus pain or unpleasantness) values.
- Some writers believe that anything good or bad is a value, but it is important not to extend the meaning of a term to the extent of making it meaningless or complicated.

**Values and Norms:**

- Values and norms are deeply related, as both are concerned with accepted assumptions about what is considered right or wrong, or desirable or undesirable.
- Values constitute the basis of norms, and norms depend on values and are justified through standards of "true," "good," and "beautiful."
- Values are more abstract, while norms are relatively specific.

**Reflection Spot:**

- Based on the classification of values by the International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, competition falls into which category of value? a) Conative b) Affective c) Achievement
    - Answer: c) Achievement

**Role of Norms:**

- Norms are rules or expectations that are socially enforced through positive and negative reinforcements.
- They include behaviors like touching the feet of elders as a sign of respect, which varies in meaning across different situations, strata, and professions.

**Personal and Social Values:**

- Humans are both creators and fulfillers of values, leading to the formation of personality, groups, and institutions in society.
- Even personal values are largely acquired from society or a segment of it to which an individual belongs.
- Strong adherence to values like perseverance, humility, and resilience is an example of personal values, while equality, humanity, and peace are important from a social perspective.

**Conclusion:**

- Values play a crucial role in shaping individual personality and society.
- In the next lecture, we will learn about the values of truth and non-violence, with a focus on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
