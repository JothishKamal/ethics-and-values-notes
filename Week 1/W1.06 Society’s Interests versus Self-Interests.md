- In a market economy, self-interest and competition drive economic activity and innovation.

#### Social Interest

- Refers to choices that benefit society as a whole, such as charity or avoiding food wastage.
- Can be linked to self-interest through Adam Smith's concept of the invisible hand, where individual actions contribute to societal well-being.

#### Linking Self-Interest and Social Interest

- Individual decisions made in self-interest, like going to work or buying goods, can also benefit society.
- However, this philosophy can fail in cases such as refusal of vaccinations or unchecked pollution controls.

#### Conclusion

- Next class will focus on personal social responsibility and its significance.

#### Additional Notes

- Social interest is inherent in all human beings and reflects an individual's awareness of belonging to the human community.
- Self-interest can lead to optimal social interest outcomes when individual decision makers act in their own self-interest.
