## Introduction

- Violence can be categorized into two main types: direct and structural violence.
- Direct violence refers to physical harm or injury inflicted on individuals or property by one or more people.
- Structural violence is deeply rooted in social, political, and economic structures, perpetuating harm and inequality.

## Direct Violence

- Mechanisms of direct violence include killing, injury, siege, sanctions, poverty, de-socialization, resocialization, underclass, repression, imprisonment, expulsion, and deportation.
- Often the result of structural inequalities, aggravated by factors like ethnic tensions, environmental degradation, and economic desperation.

## Structural Violence

- Permanent violence deeply embedded in societal structures, often accepted as societal norms.
- Arises from hierarchical relations where the privileged oppress, exploit, and dominate those at the bottom.
- Mechanisms and forms include exploitation, penetration, segmentation, marginalization, and fragmentation.

## Dimensions of Violence

- **Cultural Violence:** Symbolic violence expressed in religion, ideology, language, art, science, media, and education, legitimizing direct and structural violence.
- **Economic Violence:** Rooted in unjust economic power structures, leading to conditions like poverty, unfair hiring, insufficient healthcare, and income disparity.
- **Political Violence:** Collective actions involving great physical force for political gain, including naxalism, guerrilla warfare, and violent demonstrations.
- **Social Violence:** Consequence of abuse of political and economic powers, including crime, mob rule, revolt, and civil wars.

## Conclusion
