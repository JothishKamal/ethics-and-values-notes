- **Introduction**:
    
    - STDs are diseases primarily spread through sexual activities.
    - Commonly known as 'Venereal Diseases', but the term was changed to STDs by WHO in 1974 due to social stigma.
    - Some STDs are curable, but some like HIV, hepatitis B, and herpes cannot be cured but are preventable.
    - STDs have been present for centuries but started to gain concern in the early 20th century.
- **Impact of STDs**:
    
    - STDs have a profound impact on sexual and reproductive health.
    - Around 376 million new infections with chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis are reported globally each year.
- **STDs in India**:
    
    - According to a study by ICMR, 6% of the adult population in India has one or more STI/RTI, which means about 30-35 million episodes of STI/RTI are reported every year.
    - Sex workers in Indian metropolitan cities like Kolkata report an infection rate of around 59%.
- **Common STDs**:
    
    - Syphilis: Can be transmitted from mother to unborn child, causing serious mental and physical problems.
    - Gonorrhea: Symptoms include inflammation of the urethra and pain while passing urine.
    - Genital Herpes: Highly contagious viral infection with no known cure.
    - Chlamydial infection: Can cause infertility in women.
    - STIs like Herpes and syphilis can increase the risk of HIV acquisition.
- **HIV/AIDS**:
    
    - HIV weakens the bodyâ€™s immune system, making it susceptible to numerous infections.
    - People with HIV may remain asymptomatic for several years.
    - Modes of transmission include unprotected sex, blood exposures, and from an infected mother to the baby during pregnancy or delivery.
- **Prevention**:
    
    - Proper counseling and behavioral interventions are crucial.
    - Barrier methods like male and female condoms offer effective protection against STIs.
    - Availability, affordability, and effectiveness of STI diagnosis and treatment are essential, especially in low and middle-income countries.
- **Conclusion**:
    
    - Improving access to preventive and curative services is crucial.
    - Follow-up including vaccines and biomedical interventions are necessary for proper STI management.
