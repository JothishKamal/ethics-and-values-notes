## Introduction

- Corruption is influenced by various factors that undermine the values and ethics of society.
- Understanding these causes can help in devising strategies to combat corruption effectively.

## Causes of Corruption

1. **Political Elite**:
    
    - Emergence of a class more focused on personal gain than public welfare can lead to corruption.
2. **Artificial Scarcity**:
    
    - Creating scarcity of goods for personal gain can damage the economy and foster corruption.
3. **Value System Shift**:
    
    - Subversion of ethical values and sincerity in administration can increase corruption.
4. **Unproductive Administration**:
    
    - Corruption can stem from situations where basic needs are denied without bribery due to ineffective governance.
5. **Ineffective Oversight**:
    
    - If oversight bodies like vigilance, anti-corruption bureaus, and judiciary are ineffective, corruption can thrive unchecked.
6. **Lack of Accountability**:
    
    - Officials may engage in corrupt practices without fear of punishment due to weak accountability mechanisms.
7. **Lack of Public Outcry**:
    
    - Tolerance and lack of intense public outcry against corruption can embolden corrupt practices.
8. **Bureaucratic Nexus**:
    
    - Corruption can result from the collusion between bureaucracy, politics, and criminals.
9. **Population and Illiteracy**:
    
    - Large population size, widespread illiteracy, and poor economic infrastructure can contribute to endemic corruption.
10. **Low Pay Scales and Wages**:
    
    - Inflation and low pay can push individuals towards corruption to meet their needs.
11. **Complex Laws and Procedures**:
    
    - Complex bureaucratic processes can drive individuals to corruption for convenience.
12. **Lack of Awareness**:
    
    - Ignorance of rights, government schemes, and online services can make people vulnerable to corruption.
13. **Lack of Transparency**:
    
    - Non-transparent deals and affairs can enable corruption by allowing decisions to be made without scrutiny.
14. **Lack of Accountability**:
    
    - Failure to hold elected officials accountable for their actions can foster corruption.
15. **Unhealthy Competition**:
    
    - Cutthroat competition can drive individuals to engage in corrupt practices to gain an edge.
16. **Lack of Economic Stability**:
    
    - Economic instability can create desperation, leading to corrupt behavior.
17. **Absence of Strong Opposition**:
    
    - Lack of a robust opposition can weaken the scrutiny of government decisions, allowing corruption to flourish.
